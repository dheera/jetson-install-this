# Somehow ROS insists that you memorize some GPG key to install their stuff.
# It should be as simple as apt-add-repository ppa:ros/ppa but it seems
# they don't believe in that PPA stuff.

# apt-get was supposed to be magic.
# One wishes you could just "apt-get install ros-desktop-full" and it should magically
# figure out how to make it happen, but you have to do all this instead.

# This was all taken from this blog after 15 minutes of Googling.
# https://www.stereolabs.com/blog/ros-and-nvidia-jetson-nano/

# Nobody should have to Google. Nobody should have to read a blog. You should just have to run 1 command
# and magically get ROS. No questions asked. So here it is.
